Installing pyUVVIS
==================

There is no installation routine / setup file yet.
In order to use pyUVVIS, first make sure that all the prerequisites are met.
Then download and unpack the zip archive and execute the main file *pyUVVIS.py* using python.

I have tested/developed this program using Python 2.7, mainly due to the availability of wxPython at that time.
However, it should also run under Python 3 (maybe with some fixes to the print-syntax).

Prerequisites:
--------------

For the GUI to run, make sure you have the following installed:

    * wxPython
    * Numpy

For an OceanOptics-based spectrometer, install

    * python-seabreeze (<https://github.com/ap--/python-seabreeze>)

For a uc480-based spectrometer, also install

    * Thorlabs' *uc480* library (<http://www.thorlabs.com>).

.. note:: At the time of writing, I have been using the old uc480 library, also on linux. Meanwhile there is a new library called *ThorCam*, but I have not yet had time to integrate it.

Camera Selection:
-----------------

The program looks for uc480 and OceanOptics devices at startup.
If both are found, it will prompt a dialog to choose which one to use. If none are found,
it starts anyway and provides a randomly generated signal for testing purposes.

Currently, only the first connected uc480 or OceanOptics spectrometer can be used.
