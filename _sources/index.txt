pyUVVIS - A simple UV/VIS and Spectrometer GUI
==============================================

pyUVVIS is my attempt at providing a lightweight, simple to use GUI for UV/VIS spectroscopy.
The program operates in two major modes, as a simple spectrometer and as a UV/VIS spectrometer.
While the first is used to measure spectra of light sources, adjust illumination settings and record reference and dark spectra,
the latter is used to measure the absorption or optical density of test samples.

Supported features are:

    * Save / load spectra.
    * Live view / recording.
    * Averaging.
    * Exposure time / gain settings.
    * Automatic optimization of exposure time / gain.
    * Dark / background spectra subtraction.
    * Direct vs. UV/VIS mode.

Currently supported input devices are:

    * Thorlabs' uc480 compatible cameras.
    * OceanOptics' spectrometers through `python-seabreeze`.
